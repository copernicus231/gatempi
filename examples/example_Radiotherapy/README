This example represents the simulation of a carbon ion / proton 
irradiation covering an artificial target inside a CT patient image. 


------------
To start this example : Users need to run the "radiotherapy.mac" file
------------

Data
----

All the input data are in 'data' folder, it contains : 
- the image used in the simulation : patient1-2mm.hdr/img
- material definition : patient1-HUmaterials.db
- link between image labels and material : patient1-HU2mat.txt
- These macros read the two
  files Schneider2000MaterialsTable.txt and
  Schneider2000DensitiesTable.txt

Conversion from Hounsfield units to Geant4 materials
----------------------------------------------------

Method : see [schneider2000]. 
Start with two Hounsfield (H) tables : 
one relating H to material composition, one relating H to
mass densities. Resulting G4 materials are built by associating with
each H range in the first material table a mean density interpolated
in the second table. A parameter 'DensityTolerance' allow to
automatically split the H range composition into several material
having the same composition but different densities.

Warning : there is no CT calibration here. It is the user
responsability to convert is own Hounsfields unit with a calibration
curve.

This example represents the simulation of a proton source in a beam line,
using the PencilBeamScanning source.
This source allows for representing the optical and energetical properties of the source.

------------
Outputs:
- 4 phase spaces files (.root)
- 1 depth-dose profile in water (.txt)
> Additional root macro file is proposed to visualize the beam emmitances, spot size and energy spectrum
from the ".root" files.
------------

------------
To start this example: Users need to run the "mainMacro.mac" file
------------

------------
To visualize the output using root: Users need to run the "PhS-Analysis.C" file

This example represents the simulation of a proton source based on a pencil beam scanning treatment plan
using the TPSPencilBeamScanning source.
This source allows for simulating a stack of single pencil beams.
