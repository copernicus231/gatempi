1)   "PET_CylindricalPET_System.mac" is a macro which defined a complete simulation
      for PET application.

- The PET scanner is defined with the cylindricalPET system
- The camera is dedicated for small animal imaging 
- A phoswitch system is defined
- An orbiting movement of the camera is defined
- Phantom : water box
- Source : Carbon 11
- Dynamic acquisition : 6 frames of 1 seconde



2)   "PET_Ecat_System.mac" is a macro which defined a complete simulation
      for PET application.

- The PET scanner is defined with the ECAT system
- The camera is dedicated for whole human body imaging 
- A dead time model is included
- Phantom : water cylinder
- Source : Fluor 18

- I M P O R T A N T   P O I N T :  If the "ECAT Library" is not installed on your system, you will see the following
